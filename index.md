# Introduction

Joomla! has a very vibrant community.
People are contributing to the project in many different ways.
They write documentation, report bugs, contribute code, develop extensions, and build sites.

This book addresses the developers.
Taking a closer look at this group reveals, that there are at least three very different kinds of developers:

  - contributors
  - extension developers
  - site builders
  
They all have very different needs regarding their development environment and build processes.
